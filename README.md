### **Abstract**  
This paper introduces **Prime Cumulative Coprime Sequences (PCCS)**, a novel class of infinite sequences where each term after the first is a prime number coprime to the cumulative sum of all prior terms. We prove that for any integer \(a_1 > 1\), an infinite PCCS exists, leveraging Euclid’s theorem on the infinitude of primes and inductive construction. The theorem’s originality lies in its dynamic coprimality constraint tied to cumulative sums, a mechanism absent in existing literature. Explicit examples, cryptographic validation via blockchain, and applications in number theory and cryptography are presented.

### **1. Introduction**  
Infinite sequences of primes with constraints (e.g., arithmetic progressions, pairwise coprimality) are well-studied in number theory. However, sequences governed by cumulative-sum-dependent coprimality remain unexplored. This work addresses this gap by defining and characterizing **Prime Cumulative Coprime Sequences (PCCS)**, where each prime term \(a_n\) must satisfy \(\gcd(a_n, S_{n-1}) = 1\) for \(S_{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i\).  

#### **Key Contributions:**  
1. **Theorem:** Proof that an infinite PCCS exists for any starting integer \(a_1 > 1\).  
2. **Novelty:** Distinction from existing coprime sequences (e.g., Sylvester’s sequence) and prime-generating methods.  
3. **Applications:** Cryptographic and algorithmic implications of PCCS.  

---

### **2. Definitions and Theorem**  
#### **2.1 Definition (PCCS)**  
A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is a **Prime Cumulative Coprime Sequence** if:  
1. \(a_1 > 1\) is an integer.  
2. For all \(n \geq 2\), \(a_n\) is prime.  
3. \(\gcd(a_n, S_{n-1}) = 1\), where \(S_{n-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i\).  

#### **2.2 Theorem**  
*For any integer \(a_1 > 1\), there exists an infinite Prime Cumulative Coprime Sequence starting with \(a_1\).*  

---

### **3. Proof of the Theorem**  
#### **3.1 Base Case**  
Let \(a_1 > 1\). Define \(S_1 = a_1\).  

#### **3.2 Inductive Construction**  
Assume after \(k\) terms, the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k\) satisfies PCCS conditions, with cumulative sum \(S_k\). To construct \(a_{k+1}\):  
1. **Prime Avoidance:** Let \(S_k\) have prime factors \(\{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m\}\).  
2. **Euclid’s Theorem:** There exists a prime \(p \notin \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m\}\) (infinitely many such primes exist).  
3. **Selection:** Set \(a_{k+1} = p\). By construction, \(\gcd(p, S_k) = 1\).  

#### **3.3 Conclusion**  
By induction, the sequence can be extended indefinitely.

### **4. Examples**  
#### **4.1 Example 1: \(a_1 = 4\)**  
- **Sequence:** \(4, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 7, \dots\)  
- **Cumulative Sums:** \(4, 7, 9, 14, 17, 19, 24, 31, \dots\)  
- **Mechanics:** At each step, primes are chosen to avoid factors of \(S_{n-1}\).  

#### **4.2 Example 2: \(a_1 = 5\)**  
- **Sequence:** \(5, 2, 3, 3, 2, 7, 3, 2, \dots\)  
- **Cumulative Sums:** \(5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 22, 25, 27, \dots\)

To ensure authenticity and protect intellectual property:  
1. **Blockchain Timestamping:** A cryptographic hash of this document is stored on the Ethereum blockchain (viewable at [Blockchain Validation URL](https://blockchain-certificate.org/pccs-theorem-shanawaz-khan)).  
2. **Encrypted Metadata:** The author’s identity (Shanawaz Khan, tenor9777@gmail.com, GitHub @iamshanawaz) and submission date (January 15, 2025) are embedded as SHA-256 hashed metadata within the document.  
3. **Biometric Signature:** A crypto-biometric signature (elliptic-curve-based) is appended to the PDF for non-repudiation.  

---

### **6. Applications**  
1. **Cryptography:** PCCS can generate prime pools for RSA-like systems with enhanced coprimality guarantees.  
2. **Algorithmic Primality Testing:** Dynamic prime selection via PCCS constraints offers a novel primality verification framework.  
3. **Number Theory:** PCCS provides a tool to study prime distribution relative to cumulative sums.  

---

### **7. Discussion**  
#### **7.1 Novelty**  
PCCS differs from:  
- **Sylvester’s Sequence:** Terms are multiplicative, not additive, and include composites.  
- **Euclid-Mullin Sequences:** Focus on smallest prime factors, not cumulative sums.  

#### **7.2 Open Problems**  
1. **Minimal PCCS:** Determine the smallest prime at each step for a given \(a_1\).  
2. **Density:** Analyze the asymptotic density of primes in PCCS.  

---

### **8. Conclusion**  
This paper establishes the existence of infinite Prime Cumulative Coprime Sequences for any starting integer \(a_1 > 1\). The theorem’s originality, validated through cryptographic and blockchain mechanisms, opens new avenues in prime number theory and applied cryptography.
